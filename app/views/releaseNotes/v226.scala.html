<h1>ScalaTest/Scalactic 2.2.6 Release Notes</h1>

<p>
ScalaTest/Scalactic 2.2.6 includes the enhancements and bug fixes listed below. No source code using
ScalaTest/ScalaUtils 2.0 or higher should break, but from any version other than other 2.2.x releases (with which this release is binary
compatible), you will likely need to do a clean build to upgrade.

<h2>Bug fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fixed <code>length</code> and <code>size</code> problems in <code>assert</code>, <code>assume</code>, <code>require</code>,
 and <code>requireState</code> macros when used with a custom <code>length</code> or <code>size</code> method that returns a non-integral
 type (reported as <a href="https://github.com/scalatest/scalatest/issues/478">github issue #478</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed a <code>ClassNotFoundException</code> problem when ScalaCheck was used with fork mode in sbt.</li>
<li>Fixed an implicit numeric widening problem in ScalaTest's <code>assert</code> macro (reported as
    <a href="https://github.com/scalatest/scalatest/issues/445">github issue #445</a>).</li>
<li>Ensure <code>DiagrammedAssertions</code> can handle java static fields (reported
    as <a href="https://github.com/scalatest/scalatest/issues/615">github issue #615</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/scalatest/scalatest/issues/611">github issue #611</a>).</li>
<li>Changed <code>Framework</code> to use ScalaTest's thread pool for nested suites, instead of handling nested suites as nested
    tasks returned to sbt (reported as <a href="https://github.com/scalatest/scalatest/issues/613">github issue #613</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed a serialization failure when <code>eventually</code> was called inside a <code>withClue</code> block
    (reported as <a href="https://github.com/scalatest/scalatest/issues/358">github issue #358</a>).</li>
<li>Made <code>Every</code> extend <code>Serializable</code> (reported as
    <a href="https://github.com/scalatest/scalatest/issues/663">github issue #663</a>).</li>
